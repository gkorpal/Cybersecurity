In Task 2, you will need to brute force all the keys possible during the giving time range. To do this you
can use the date command to get the time elapsed in seconds first, and then write a short C program to
generate and store all the possible keys in a file. Then you can write a script to encrypt the known
plaintext using all the possible keys and compare with the ciphertext. You can use either C or python to
do this, or bash script.
