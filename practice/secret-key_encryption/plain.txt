The learning objective of this lab is for students to get familiar with the concepts in the secret-key 
encryption and some common attacks on encryption. From this lab, students will gain a first-hand
experience on encryption algorithms, encryption modes, paddings, and initial vector (IV). 
Moreover, students will be able to use tools and write programs to encrypt/decrypt messages.
Many common mistakes have been made by developers in using the encryption algorithms and modes. These 
mistakes weaken the strength of the encryption, and eventually lead to vulnerabilities. This lab
exposes students to some of these mistakes, and ask students to launch attacks to exploit those
vulnerabilities. Please answer the following question: How much information can you recover by
decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB, respectively?
Please answer this question before you conduct this task, and then find out whether your 
answer is correct or wrong after you finish this task. Please provide justification.
